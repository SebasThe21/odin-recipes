    <h2>Two ingredients for the pizza</h2>
    <p>Here's what you'll need to make this two-ingredient pizza dough:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>· <b>Self-rising flour:</b> You'll need 1 ½ cups of self-rising flour. If you only have all-purpose flour on hand, you can make a DIY version with just a few ingredients.</li>
        <li>· <b>Yogurt:</b> Plain Greek yogurt holds the dough together and ensures a tender texture. Make sure you get authentic Greek yogurt and not Greek-style yogurt.</li>
